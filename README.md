# DurhamCalendar

By default the Durham myTimetable feed shows the module code as the title of calander events. This is undescripitve and provides little information on the event.

This notebook edits the calander feed so that each event has a descriptive name that includes the module name and room number.

## Limitations

The program does not provide a live feed only a static .ics file. Future itterations may produce a live feed that will refresh to reflect calander changes.
